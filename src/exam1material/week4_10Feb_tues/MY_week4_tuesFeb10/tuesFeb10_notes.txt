HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?

    Try OrE on premise
    Subproof: assume p or Q
    
    goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
    top level is rightmost or
    could introduce or if have r or Q
        or if i have P

        nested OrE
        Subproof: assume(p)
            goal:  r ∨ q ∨ p
        
        subproof: assume Q
        goal:  r ∨ q ∨ p
        first get r or Q
        then get r or q or P
    
    subproof: assume r


    How to build conclusion?





Exam 1 is Thursday, February 12
    Exam review session (by Erik and Drake):
        Wednesday, February 11, 2:30-5:00 pm in DUE 1118

No new homework this week

/////////////////////

Today:
- more involved natural deduction examples
- exam 1 review
tomorrow 230-5 cs lounge

/////////////////////

Reminder: implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P,P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



Implies symbol.

Typing a → in Logika for natural deduction:

    __>:

(two underscores, >, :)

//////////////////////////

Bigger examples: ex1.sc, ex2.sc, ex3.sc


/////////////////////////

Logika features/tips

- see proof step summary
- renumber/reformat proofs
- interpreting errors


/////////////////////////

General proof strategy to this point

1) list premises
2) breakdown any premises you can to get extra information

3) look at the conclusion

4) consider if you will need OrE (probably will if you have an OR)

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point

How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1:

    Approach 2:




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?




What is satisfiability? 

    need ONE truth assigbment where the stteament outputs true
    (if we did a truth table, would be a tautology or contingent)

To show NOT satisfiable?

    need FULL truth table to show the statement always outputs false
    (i.e, is contradictory)



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

        premises, conclusion

    valid: 
        if for every truth assignment where all premises are true, 
        the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid?
        1) truth table with all premises and conclusion
        look at truth assignments that make all premises true,
        make sure they make the conclusion true

        2) deduction

    how prove invalid?
        find ONE truth assignment where all premises true 
        but conclusion false

        can't prove invalid with deduction


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
